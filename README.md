This Unreal Engine project, written entirely in C++, includes the following features:

Multiple types of weapons with the ability to pick them up.
Shooting mechanics implemented for each type of weapon.
NPC shooting with an assault rifle attached to hand sockets.
Shooting animations for both NPCs and the player.

The project demonstrates basic gameplay mechanics for weapon interaction and animations, with all elements implemented in C++ without using Blueprints.
